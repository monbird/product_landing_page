FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page

This is the third of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp and the objective was to build a product landing page that meets Free Code Camp's user stories.

The page could be used as an online presence of a pet spa saloon that advertises its available services.
